# Django-learning-track 🌿✨

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I’m documenting my journey of learning **Django** — one day at a time.

This repo is a living journal of everything I’m learning, building, and experimenting with as I dive deeper into backend web development using Django. Whether it’s setting up models, exploring views, or connecting a database — you’ll find it all here.

---

## 🌱 What’s in here?

- **Daily updates** – I’ll be logging my progress every day. Think of it as a dev diary.
- **Concept notes** – Clear, beginner-friendly notes on Django concepts as I learn them.
- **Mini projects** – Small, fun projects to apply what I’ve learned.
- **Debugging tips** – Gotchas and errors I run into (and how I fix them).
- **Personal reflections** – Thoughts, insights, and “aha!” moments along the way.

## 🎯 Why I’m doing this

I believe in learning by doing — and sharing.  
This repo helps me stay consistent, track my growth, and maybe even help someone else who’s walking the same path.

If you’re learning Django too, feel free to explore, fork, or leave a note. Let’s learn and grow together! 💫

Thanks for stopping by!
